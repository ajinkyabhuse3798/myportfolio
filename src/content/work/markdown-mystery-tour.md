Performed extensive Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on loan application datasets to identify key patterns and correlations. Using machine learning techniques like Linear Regression and Decision Trees, I developed predictive models for loan sanction approvals. By optimizing model parameters and improving feature selection, the project achieved an 18% reduction in Mean Squared Error (MSE).
