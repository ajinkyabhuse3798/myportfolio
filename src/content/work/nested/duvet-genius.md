In this project, we developed a cutting-edge Aspect-Based Sentiment Analysis (ABSA) framework by integrating Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) and the LLaMA-70B large language model. The primary goal was to accurately identify and analyze sentiments associated with specific aspects of a product, service, or text.

The framework leverages:
	•	Graph Neural Networks: To model the relationships between aspects and contextual words, effectively capturing intricate dependencies within the text.
	•	LLaMA-70B: A state-of-the-art large language model that enhances semantic understanding, ensuring accurate and context-aware sentiment classification.

This dual-model approach combines the strengths of both architectures to deliver a robust and scalable ABSA system. The project demonstrates significant improvements in sentiment analysis tasks, making it highly suitable for applications such as product reviews, customer feedback analysis, and opinion mining.
