Designed and implemented a comprehensive business intelligence platform for analyzing Mumsnetâ€™s data. By normalizing the database to ensure data integrity and efficiency, I created a robust foundation for advanced reporting. Developed OLAP cube measures and interactive dashboards that provided valuable insights into user behavior, sales trends, and customer engagement. These insights enabled stakeholders to make data-driven decisions, improving business outcomes and operational efficiency.
